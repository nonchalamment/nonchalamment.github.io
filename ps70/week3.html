      (Okay, to be fair, it strums more than it arpeggiates.)
    </p>
    <p>This kinetic sculpture is meant to hit or pluck strings as it hammers down on the strings of an instrument, or in this case, a handmade "guitar," with a DIY tuning mechanism. 
      The sculpture is operated via a DC motor attached to one of the axles that control each hammering mechanism.

      I first got the inspiration from this video:

      I was watching this video for inspirations on what to do for this project. I knew I wanted to do something musical, of course. 
      Then I came across the quick return mechanism, and I thought, this would be perfect for plucking a string! 
      I decided that I would make an instrument that would be plucked in an arpeggiated manner, since that's a musical gesture that's often used for ornamentation of a chord.

      I then designed the hollowed-out stick in Fusion 360 then laser cut acrylic for the wheel and stick, then mounted the whole thing on a square dowel, 
      then repeated the whole thing over across 3 more mounts.

      The metal dowel I used for the axle was way too heavy, so I made the decision to switch over to plastic dowels that I found in a deep corner of the makerspace, 
      which made it so much easier to rotate the wheel to activate the mechanism. Here you can see the mechanism work!

      Then I realized I need to think of a way to rotate all 4 axles all together. Gears to the rescue!

      Here it is, with the motor. It worked! Now that I'd finished the main mechanism, it was time to work on the stringed instrument that would be plucked.

      Full disclosure: I got the idea for the tuning mechanism for the instrument from <a href="https://makezine.com/article/workshop/woodworking/tricks-for-diy-tuning-pegs/">here.</a> 
      It's made up of a bolt, nut, and washer. The string is tied to the washer and lengthens as the nut is moved closer to the base of the bolt, causing it to stretch.

    <p>
      And here it is!
