      (Okay, to be fair, it strums more than it arpeggiates.)
    </p>
    <p>This kinetic sculpture is meant to hit or pluck strings as it hammers down on the strings of an instrument, or in this case, a handmade "guitar," with a DIY tuning mechanism. 
      The sculpture is operated via a DC motor attached to one of the axles that control each hammering mechanism.

      I first got the inspiration from this video:

      I was watching this video for inspirations on what to do for this project. I knew I wanted to do something musical, of course. 
      Then I came across the quick return mechanism, and I thought, this would be perfect for plucking a string! 
      I decided that I would make an instrument that would be plucked in an arpeggiated manner, since that's a musical gesture that's often used for ornamentation of a chord.

      I then designed the hollowed-out stick in Fusion 360 then laser cut acrylic for the wheel and stick, then mounted the whole thing on a square dowel.
