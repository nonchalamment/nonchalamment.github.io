    <p>For this week's press construction kit project, I chose a triangular shape that is reminiscent of a fidget spinner. The triangular shapes can be fit in an octagonal pattern that leads to a ball-like structure. 
      Theoretically this is a shape that can be repeated ad nauseum. 
      It's a really tight fit, but I didn't want it to be too loose. 
      Everything was modeled in Fusion 360 and cut with a laser cutter. 
      I had fun creating circle tangent curves that didn't look awkward.

      In order to refresh my memory for modeling in Fusion 360, I followed a basic Youtube tutorial about creating sketches and extruding. 
      I created a random shape in sketch mode using the line function. 
      I actually had no idea before the tutorial that you can click and drag on the end of a line to create a circular arc. 
      After creating the sketch, I revolved the 2D shape around the Y axis and got this stepped donut-like shape.

      The first object I chose to model is an old sake bottle that I now use as a vase. 
      I had a lot of difficulty trying to visualize the bottle top shape; 
      first I tried to think of the transition between the square bottle and the round neck as sort of a pyramid that needed to be filleted.
      However, it was better served by thinking of it as a piece of a sphere.
      I filleted the sharp edges then added a lip to the bottle.
      I tried hollowing out the model but couldn't succeed. My suspicion is that during cutting out the sphere piece, I messed up extruding somehow.
      Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out despite the minor kinks. It was a good challenge trying to visualize the bottle top.

      The second object model was a rook. 
      This one was a bit trickier, surprisingly, considering it was radially symmetrical. 
      I had to create and offset a lot of planes and use a conic curve, which I had never done in Fusion 360 before. 
      Unlike the bottle, I tried to carve out the hollow portion of the piece, and I had to consider the thickness of the wall and make sure to offset the conic curve.
