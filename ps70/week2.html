    <p>For this week's laser cutting project, I chose a triangular shape that is reminiscent of a fidget spinner. The triangular shapes can be fit in an octagonal pattern that leads to a ball-like structure.
      It's a really tight fit, but I didn't want it to be too loose.

    <p>The first object I chose to model is an old sake bottle that is now used as a vase. I had a lot of difficulty trying to visualize the shape; first I tried to think of the transition between the square bottle and the round neck as sort of a pyramid.
      However, it was better served by thinking of it as a piece of a sphere.
      I filleted the sharp edges then added a lip to the bottle.
      I tried hollowing out the model but couldn't succeed. My suspicion is that during cutting out the sphere piece, I messed up extruding somehow.
      Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. It was a good challenge.
