	 <p>Seiyoung Jang (b. 1993) is a Korean-American composer and maker currently based in San Leandro, CA. She aims to celebrate manifestations of organic forms in resistance against thoughtless sterility, with a focus on inter-/intrapersonal psychological processes, communication, and coloration. She has studied with Matthew Burtner, Judith Shatin, Ted Coffey, Peter Bussigel, Luke Dahl, Pauline Oliveros, John Bischoff, and Laetitia Sonami, among others. Seiyoung's works have been performed at the 2017 and 2018 SEAMUS Conferences, as well as the 2017 NSEME. Seiyoung recently obtained a M.F.A. in Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College in Oakland, CA and previously obtained a B.A. in Psychology and Music from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA.</p>
